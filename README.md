GeoCraft is an interactive project that dives into geospatial data visualization. Specifically, it focuses on earthquake data.

Here are the key details:
1. Data Organization:
   - We organize earthquake data based on three critical factors:
     - Magnitude: The earthquake's value (measured on the Richter scale).
     - Depth: How deep the earthquake occurred beneath the Earth's surface.
     - Affected Countries: Geospatial information about the countries impacted by each earthquake.

2. Functionality:
   - GeoCraft's program calculates and prints the number of earthquakes in each country.
   - It arranges the countries in descending order based on the total value of earthquakes they've experienced.

3. Technologies and Principles:
   - We leverage several libraries, including the powerful Unfolding Maps library.
   - Sorting algorithms play a crucial role in organizing the data efficiently.
   - GeoCraft adheres to the principles of Object-Oriented Programming, ensuring maintainability and scalability.
